## Erlang Koans
Inspired by <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">the ruby koans</a>.

### Usage
The koans are intended to only rely on erlang and bash. The testing framework is <a href="http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/eunit/chapter.html">eunit</a>.
To run use the koans executable with the command `koans run`. This will compile your code and provide the next failing test in the suite to pass.
